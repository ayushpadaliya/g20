            The G20 Agriculture Deputies Group was created during the French Presidency in 2011 to deal with volatility in global food prices. It has since become an important forum to enhance cooperation among the G20 members on agriculture related issues critical for achieving UN 2030 agenda, especially the goal of zero hunger (SDG 2). The working group facilitates information exchange and cooperation on a range of global issues such as food security, nutrition, antimicrobial resistance, food waste and loss, sustainability, and resilient and inclusive food value chains.

            The G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) was established in 2010. The Anti-Corruption Working Group reports to the G20 Leaders on anti-corruption issues and aims to establish minimum common standards among the legal systems of the G20 countries, in order to combat corruption. It focuses on public and private sector integrity and transparency, bribery, international cooperation, asset recovery, beneficial ownership transparency, vulnerable sectors and capacity-building.

            The G20 Culture Ministers met for the first time in 2020 and highlighted culture’s cross-cutting contribution to advancing G20 agenda. Recognizing the synergies between culture and other policy areas, and considering the impact of culture, cultural heritage and the creative economy on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development, culture was integrated into the G20 agenda as a Culture Working Group in 2021. The group aims to strengthen international cooperation and collaboration to support cultural and creative industries.

                    G20 countries have a high level of exposure to disaster risk, with a combined estimated Annual Average Loss of $218 billion or 9% of their average annual investment in infrastructure. G20 Leaders’ declarations have from time to time acknowledged the importance of disaster risk reduction and resilience. However, the issue has not been addressed by the G20 in a comprehensive and sustained manner. A new working group on Disaster Risk Reduction has therefore been established under India's Presidency to encourage collective work by the G20, undertake multi-disciplinary research and exchange best practices on disaster risk reduction.

After the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Goals in 2015, DWG has played an important role in supporting Sherpas in both driving the G20 Sustainable Development agenda and in working with other workstreams to better understand the sustainable development intersections of G20 actions with efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda.

                                        Energy has been discussed in the G20 as a critical element for sustainable global economy since 2009. A dedicated Energy Sustainability Working Group was established in 2013 to discuss energy related issues. In 2017, energy was discussed as part of the Climate Sustainability Working Group. During the Argentine Presidency in 2018, the energy issues were de-linked from climate and steered towards discussions on energy transition under the Energy Transition Working Group. The Working Group deliberates on energy security, accessibility and affordability, energy efficiency, renewable energy, innovation, technology and financing.
